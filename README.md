# jev-trace

**Generate a reviewable requirements-to-code-and-tests matrix, with uncovered clauses, orphan artifacts and exact change impact.**

[![Tests](https://github.com/gbesse/jev-trace/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gbesse/jev-trace/actions/workflows/test.yml) ![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue) ![Node](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-22%2B-green) ![Public alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-public_alpha-orange)

## 30-second offline quick start
`git clone https://github.com/gbesse/jev-trace.git && cd jev-trace && npm install && npm run demo` uses synthetic matches.

## Call real Jev
Set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` before a reviewed adapter sends paid candidate-pair requests to `api.typesafe.ai`. The alpha adapter is unwired; `npm run live-smoke` makes zero calls.

## Library and integration
Import clause parsers, artifact splitting, `retrieve`, `questions`, `matrix`, `impact`, `check`, and `htmlReport`. Commit the resulting matrix so human review is a diff.

## How it decides
Identifiers, configured path hints and token overlap retrieve bounded candidates. Source artifacts receive an implements question; tests separately receive implements and verifies questions. Coverage is exactly the share of clauses with one accepted match, never a quality measure. Hash changes identify cells to re-review without inference.

## Boundaries
An accepted relation is retrieval/judgment assistance—not proof of correct implementation. A person signs the matrix. Splitting is deliberately language-agnostic and partial. CSV writing, CLI/git invocation and live provider remain unwired in this alpha. No benchmark is claimed.

## Validation
Run `npm run check && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run demo`; CI uses Node 22 and 24.
